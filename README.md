# VocabularyImporter

You want to import a list of your new vocabularies? But you dont want to look up all the translations yourself? Then use the VocabularyImporter! You dont just get the translations, but also example sentences, pictures, and audio samples if you want. 

The VocabularyImporter uses the glosbe.com API and website. From the translations, example sentences, images and audio samples get downloaded. Then the content gets inserted into the Anki database.   

Because the program is based on the glosbe.com's API, there might be problems if you want to add too many vocabs in one day. But if its not way too much it should be fine.
