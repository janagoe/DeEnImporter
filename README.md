# DeEnAnkiImporter

You want to import a list of your new German vocabularies? But you dont want to look up the definitions yourself? Then use AnkiImporter! You dont just get the definitions. But also example sentences, pictures, and audio samples if you want. 

AnkiImporter looks up the definitions on dict.cc for your wanted vocabulary, searches for example sentences on wiktionary.org and downloads pictures and audio from glosbe.com.
