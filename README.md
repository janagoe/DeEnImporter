# DeEnAnkiImporter

You want to import a list of your new German vocabularies? But you dont want to look up the definitions yourself? Then use the DeEnImporter! You dont just get the translations, but also example sentences, pictures, and audio samples if you want. 

AnkiImporter looks up everything on glosbe.com for your wanted vocabulary, searches for example sentences on wiktionary.org and downloads pictures and audio automatically. 

The program is based on the glosbe.com's API. There might be problems if you want to add too many vocabs in one day. 

First working version is released.
